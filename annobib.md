May, RM. 1972. Will a large complex system be stable? _Nature_ 238: 413-414. 

- May extends the work of Gardner and Ashby, who only looked at small systems (4-10)
- simulates a matrix whose diagonal is -1, and off-diagonal is drawn from a distribution with equal sign probabilities
- large random matrix will be stable if alpha < (n)^{-1/2} [where alpha is mean interaction strength" and unstable if the inequality is reversed
- Connectance is the probability that any pair of species will interact
- with matrices whose connectance is less than 1, it will be stable if alpha < (n*C)^{-1/2} and unstable if the inequality is reversed
- within a web species which interact with many others should do so weakly, and those that interact strongly shouls do so with but a few species
- in multi-species communities for a given alpha, n and C, they will do better if they are arranged in blocks
